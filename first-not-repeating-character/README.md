### First Not Repeating Character

Given a string `s`, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. 
If there is no such character, return `'_'`.

##### Examples

* For `s = "abacabad"`, the output should be `firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'`. <br>There are two non-repeating characters in the string: `'c'` and `'d'`. Return `c` since it appears in the string first.

* For `s = "abacabaabacaba"`, the output should be `firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = '_'`. <br><br>There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.
